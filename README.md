# Infernium Theme

A high-contrast light theme inspired by molten lava flows and biomechanical machinery. Industrial greys and metallic whites form the base, while glowing oranges, deep reds, and molten highlights accentuate the UI for a dramatic, mechanical-organic feel.

Molten Mechanica – Subtle light grey bases with glowing lava accents to create a living, industrial UI.

Lava Flow Accents – Warm molten oranges and reds highlight interactive elements and focus areas.
